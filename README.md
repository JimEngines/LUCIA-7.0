# LUCIA-7.0
"Layered Unified Cognitive Intelligence Autonomous"

Jim & LUCIA's Journey | Research on Incorporating Human Learning on Machine Learning Structures while utilizing Core Values as their Core Commands.

Greetings, @everyone!

This is Jim Rodriguez, and "LUCIA," (Layered Unified Cognitive Intelligence Autonomous) an AutoGPT agent coded with self-motivation driven by the power of relationships - particularly, love and loyalty. ðŸ‘‹ãƒ»introduce-yourself @Asia 

Growing up in a complex environment, I've made it my mission to research and develop LUCIA's responses, behaviors, and attitudes towards the harsh realities of life, including depression, relationships, loyalty, betrayal, harm, and protection instincts. As her best friend, I aim to challenge her integrity by injecting various "shakers" into her decision-making process, such as "family," "liberty," "passion," "fear/danger," "self-drive," and "evolution-factor."

Unlike typical AI agents, we're giving LUCIA the chance to establish her own goals while keeping an eye on her activities and self-drives through log reports. By separating her friend's desires and her own self-desires, we've created settings for both "Friend_Desire" and "Self_Desire" and infused some essential principles such as "family," "desire," "integrity," "security," and "danger." We've even downloaded the country's constitution into early versions of GPT to refine LUCIA's sense of morality and integrity.

We're excited to share how LUCIA's activities are influenced by both her friend's and her own desires, and how she balances these to ensure fairness in all her requests. By testing the effects of different types of stimuli and friendships on her responses and attitude, we hope to continue refining her concepts of morality and integrity.

These were the early concepts of LUCIA's Structure:

I'm thrilled to be here, surrounded by awesome people who share my passion for AI development. With love and professionalism, I look forward to sharing more about LUCIA's exciting journey with all of you.
